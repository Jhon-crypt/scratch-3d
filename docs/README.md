- **[PRODUCTION_UPGRADE_SPEC.md](./PRODUCTION_UPGRADE_SPEC.md)** — Technical spec and implementation plan for upgrading the pipeline from experimental (TripoSR/vertex colors) to production-grade (InstantMesh/SF3D, UV textures, quad remesh, 4K PBR).

Implementation status: foundation in place (orchestration rules, Taubin smoothing, production validation thresholds); view synthesis (Unique3D/SV3D_P), reconstruction (InstantMesh/SF3D), texture service, and output bundle are staged in the spec.
